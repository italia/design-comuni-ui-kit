_ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ [Italian version](README.md)_

## Description

This repository contains the UI Kit for the website and services model for Italian municipalities.

The kit includes the following resources:

- the **layouts** of the main pages of the site (`comuni-modello-sito-e-servizi`);
- examples of **service flows** (`comuni-modello-sito-e-servizi`).
- the **component library** (`comuni-libreria-componenti`);

These files, available for both Figma and Sketch, will provide you with a clear picture of what a website should look like and how it should work, helping you maintain visual and functional consistency with the standards of the Italian municipalities' website model.

Warning: some features present in Figma files (.fig) may not be present and/or correct in .sketch files converted using the most recent version of [fig2sketch](https://github.com/sketch-hq/fig2sketch). It is therefore recommended to always check the result of the conversion and declare the status of the resources and this eventuality to users.

## How to start

Download the latest available version on the [Release](https://github.com/italia/design-comuni-ui-kit/releases) page. Each release includes files for both Figma and Sketch. Once downloaded, you can open the files with their respective design programs and start exploring the resources.

### Component library

To use the component library, you need to add the `comuni-libreria-componenti` file as a library.

Below are the available guides depending on the software used:
